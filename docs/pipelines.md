Question:
Can NoteBookLM help us draft an initial version of our content even without a prior discussion with the SME? Or can it help us better prepare for conversations related to our tasks?

Answer:
Yes, it can. Not only does it generate a strong first draft, but it also provides detailed insights into the updates and their impact.

How?
I uploaded a GitHub PR that the SME had reviewed for one of the engineering Jiras into NoteBookLM, along with the content I needed to update. I then used NoteBookLM to refine the draft.

Result:
The SME approved the long-form content with just a single comment.
